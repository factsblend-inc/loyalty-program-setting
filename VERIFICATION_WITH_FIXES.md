Gross Margin: 65%
Reward Budget: 3%
Redemption Rate: 60%
Fixed Program Cost: ฿15,000/month

# BASE PROGRAM - CORRECTED ✅

## Before Fix (WRONG):
```
Additional Revenue = ฿350,000 × 15% = ฿52,500 ❌ (applied to ALL revenue)
Gross Profit = ฿52,500 × 65% = ฿34,125
Net Profit = ฿34,125 - ฿25,500 = ฿8,625
ROI = 33.8% ❌ INFLATED
```

## After Fix (CORRECT):
```
Member Revenue = ฿350,000 × 70% = ฿245,000
Additional Revenue = ฿245,000 × 15% = ฿36,750 ✅ (only from members)
Gross Profit = ฿36,750 × 65% = ฿23,888
Net Profit = ฿23,888 - ฿25,500 = -฿1,612
ROI = -6.3% ✅ REALISTIC
```

### Economic Interpretation:
- 70% of transactions (฿245,000) are from loyalty members
- Members spend/visit 15% more than non-members
- Incremental benefit = ฿36,750
- After gross margin: ฿23,888 profit
- Program costs ฿25,500
- **Net: Slight loss in month 1, but builds customer lifetime value**

**This is now economically sound!** ✅

# CAMPAIGN CALCULATIONS - ALL VERIFIED ✅

## 1. Point Multiplier ✅ CORRECT

```javascript
// Weekend Double Points: 3 days, 2X, 30% participation, 20% extra spending
Duration: 3/30 = 0.1 months
Participants: 1,000 × 0.30 × 0.1 = 30 transactions
Spending: ฿350 × 1.20 = ฿420
Revenue: 30 × ฿420 = ฿12,600
Incremental: ฿12,600 - (30 × ฿350) = ฿2,100
Point Cost: (฿12,600 × 0.03) × 2 = ฿756
Marketing: ฿500
Total Cost: ฿1,256
Gross Profit: ฿2,100 × 0.65 = ฿1,365
Net Profit: ฿1,365 - ฿1,256 = ฿109
ROI: 8.7% ✅
```

**Verification:** Small positive ROI for 3-day campaign - realistic ✅

---

## 2. Group Reward ✅ FIXED

### Before Fix (WRONG):
```
Participants: 1,000 × 0.15 × 1 × 4 = 600 people
Revenue: 600 × ฿455 = ฿273,000 ❌ INFLATED 4X!
```

### After Fix (CORRECT):
```javascript
// Family Dining: 4+ people, 50 points/person, 15% participation, 25% extra spending
Group Transactions: 1,000 × 0.15 × 1 = 150 transactions
Total People: 150 × 4 = 600 people (for points)
Spending: ฿350 × 1.25 = ฿437.50
Revenue: 150 × ฿437.50 = ฿65,625 ✅ CORRECT
Incremental: ฿65,625 - (150 × ฿350) = ฿13,125
Point Cost: 600 people × 50 points × ฿0.175 = ฿5,250
Marketing: ฿500
Total Cost: ฿5,750
Gross Profit: ฿13,125 × 0.65 = ฿8,531
Net Profit: ฿8,531 - ฿5,750 = ฿2,781
ROI: 48.4% ✅
```

**Verification:** Positive ROI makes sense - groups spend more ✅

---

## 3. Spending Tier ✅ FIXED

### Before Fix (WRONG):
```
Incremental Revenue: 0 ❌
ROI: -100% ❌
```

### After Fix (CORRECT):
```javascript
// Spend ฿5000 tier: 25% participation, ฿500 bonus
Participants: 1,000 × 0.25 × 1 = 250 transactions
Spending Incentive: ฿350 × 1.20 = ฿420 (customers spend 20% more to reach tier)
Revenue: 250 × ฿420 = ฿105,000
Incremental: ฿105,000 - (250 × ฿350) = ฿17,500 ✅
Achievers: 250 × 0.60 = 150 (60% reach threshold)
Point Cost: 150 × ฿500 = ฿75,000
Marketing: ฿1,500
Total Cost: ฿76,500
Gross Profit: ฿17,500 × 0.65 = ฿11,375
Net Profit: ฿11,375 - ฿76,500 = -฿65,125
ROI: -85.1%
```

**Verification:** Negative ROI - ฿500 bonus is too high! Merchant should reduce it ✅
**Calculator working correctly - showing merchant this won't work!**

---

## 4. Referral ✅ CORRECT (No Changes)

```javascript
// 20 new customers, ฿100 referee bonus, ฿100 referrer bonus
New Customers: 20
Revenue: 20 × ฿350 = ฿7,000 (all incremental)
Point Cost: 20 × (฿100 + ฿100) = ฿4,000
Marketing: ฿1,000
Total Cost: ฿5,000
Gross Profit: ฿7,000 × 0.65 = ฿4,550
Net Profit: ฿4,550 - ฿5,000 = -฿450
ROI: -9.0%
```

**Verification:** Slight loss in month 1, but new customers have lifetime value ✅

```javascript
// Birthday bonus: ฿150/person, 50 occasions/month, 30% extra spending
Occasions: 50 per month
Spending: ฿350 × 1.30 = ฿455
Revenue: 50 × ฿455 = ฿22,750

Point Cost: 50 × ฿150 = ฿7,500
Marketing: ฿300
Total Cost: ฿7,800
Gross Profit: ฿5,250 × 0.65 = ฿3,413
Net Profit: ฿3,413 - ฿7,800 = -฿4,388
ROI: -56.3%
```

**Verification:** ฿150 bonus might be too high, merchant should test ฿100 ✅

---

## 6. Minimum Purchase ✅ CORRECT (No Changes)

```javascript
// Min ฿500 purchase, ฿30 bonus, 30% participation, 15% extra spending
Duration: 14/30 = 0.467 months
Participants: 1,000 × 0.30 × 0.467 = 140 transactions

Point Cost: 140 × ฿30 = ฿4,200
Marketing: ฿800
Total Cost: ฿5,000
Gross Profit: ฿7,350 × 0.65 = ฿4,778

## 7. Time-Based (Happy Hour) ✅ IMPROVED

### Before Fix (Confusing):
```
hourlyParticipation = (3/24) × 0.25 = 3.125% ❓
```

### After Fix (Clear):
```javascript
// Happy Hour 3pm-6pm: 3 hours, 20% participation, 10% extra spending
Business Hours/Day: 12 hours (assumption)
Time Window: 3/12 = 25% of business day
Daily Transactions: 1,000/30 = 33.3 per day
Happy Hour Trans: 33.3 × 0.25 = 8.33 per day
Participating: 8.33 × 0.20 = 1.67 per day
Monthly: 1.67 × 30 × 1 = 50 transactions
Spending: ฿350 × 1.10 = ฿385
Revenue: 50 × ฿385 = ฿19,250
Incremental: ฿19,250 - (50 × ฿350) = ฿1,750
Point Cost: (฿19,250 × 0.03) × 1.5 = ฿866
Marketing: ฿1,000
Total Cost: ฿1,866
Gross Profit: ฿1,750 × 0.65 = ฿1,138

```

### After Fix (CORRECT):
```javascript
// Visit 5 times in 30 days, get ฿100 bonus, 25% participation
Avg Normal Visits: 2.5/month (assumption)
Required Visits: 5
Unique Customers: 1,000 / 2.5 = 400 customers
Participating: 400 × 0.25 × 1 = 100 customers
Extra Visits Needed: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5 visits
Total Extra Visits: 100 × 2.5 = 250 visits
Incremental Revenue: 250 × ฿350 = ฿87,500 ✅
Point Cost: 100 × ฿100 = ฿10,000

# USAGE NOTES FOR MERCHANTS

## ROI Expectations:
- **Positive ROI (>20%)**: Excellent campaign, scale it up

- **Negative ROI (-50% to 0%)**: May be worth it for lifetime value
- **Very Negative (<-50%)**: Reduce rewards or stop campaign

## The calculator will now show REALISTIC numbers:
- Base program may show negative/low ROI initially (normal!)
- Campaigns with high bonuses will show negative ROI (warning!)
- Frequency campaigns show high ROI (drive more visits)
- Referral campaigns may be negative short-term (LTV play)

**Merchants can now make confident decisions based on accurate math!**
